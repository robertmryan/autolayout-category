# Auto Layout Category

--

## Introduction

This is a Objective-C category that provides a series of convenience methods for creating auto layout constraints. This is particularly useful for setting centering constraints, which aren't easily done in visual format language. It also provides a few methods for quickly finding constraints in case you want to change or replace them as controls are moved and/or resized.

See the [class reference](robertmryan.github.io/autolayout-category) for more information.

This was developed using Xcode 5, and tested with iOS 6 and iOS 7.
